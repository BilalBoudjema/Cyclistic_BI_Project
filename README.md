### Project Background

**Primary dataset:** NYC Citi Bike Trips  
**Secondary dataset:** Census Bureau US Boundaries

Cyclistic has established a partnership with New York City, offering bike-sharing services across Manhattan and adjacent boroughs. The Customer Growth Team is crafting a business plan for the upcoming year, aiming to understand customer usage patterns, especially the demand at different station locations.

#### Data Captured

- Trip start and end times and locations (station number, latitude/longitude)
- Bike identification numbers
- Customer types (one-time or subscriber)

The team requires a dashboard to summarize the vast data from millions of rides, providing clear insights for the leadership team.

### Stakeholders

- **Sara Romero**, VP, Marketing
- **Ernest Cox**, VP, Product Development
- **Jamal Harris**, Director, Customer Data
- **Nina Locklear**, Director, Procurement
- **Team Members:**
  - Adhira Patel, API Strategist
  - Megan Pirato, Data Warehousing Specialist
  - Rick Andersson, Manager, Data Governance
  - Tessa Blackwell, Data Analyst
  - Brianne Sand, Director, IT
  - Shareefah Hakimi, Project Manager

*Primary contacts: Adhira, Megan, Rick, and Tessa.*

Per Sara: The dashboard should be accessible, with options for large print and text-to-speech.

### Project Approvals and Dependencies

Data access approvals are required from Jamal and other teams for product-specific data.

### Project Goal

Grow Cyclistic’s Customer Base by understanding customer needs, product success, and the potential for new station locations to meet demand.

### Deliverables and Metrics

- Visualization of starting and ending station locations.
- Popular destination visualization based on total trip minutes.
- Trend analysis from the summer of 2015.
- Year-over-year growth percentage in the number of trips.
- Insights on station congestion and peak usage patterns.

*The dashboard must be completed within 6 weeks!*

### Measure Success

Analyze year-long data to assess the impact of seasonality on usage and understand customer demand patterns.

### Other Considerations

- The dataset lacks detailed geographic aggregation; a separate database will be provided.
- Weather data limitations.
- Consideration of bike availability at starting locations.
- Data anonymization to protect user privacy.
