# 🚴 Cyclistic BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview
As part of my BI project at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in New York City, I focused on delivering business intelligence value through data capture, analysis, and monitoring. This project aims to understand customer behavior, identify station demand, and support strategic decisions to grow Cyclistic's customer base.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze customer behavior to understand usage patterns.
- **Station Demand**: Identify high-demand stations and peak usage times.
- **Growth Strategy**: Provide insights to support new station placements and customer growth.

## 📂 Data Sources
1. **Primary Dataset**: NYC Citi Bike Trips
2. **Secondary Dataset**: Census Bureau US Boundaries

### 📊 Data Captured
- 📍 Trip start and end times and locations (station number, latitude/longitude)
- 🚲 Bike identification numbers
- 👤 Customer types (one-time or subscriber)

## 👥 Key Stakeholders
- **Sara Romero**: VP, Marketing
- **Ernest Cox**: VP, Product Development
- **Jamal Harris**: Director, Customer Data

*📌 Primary contacts: Adhira, Megan, Rick, and Tessa.*

## 🎯 Project Goals
The primary goal is to provide actionable insights through a dashboard that supports Cyclistic’s customer growth by analyzing historical data and identifying areas for operational improvements.

## 📦 Deliverables
1. **Interactive Dashboard**: Summarizes customer behavior and station demand.
2. **Visualizations**:
   - 📊 Starting and ending station locations
   - 📈 Popular destinations based on total trip minutes
   - 📅 Year-over-year growth analysis since summer 2015
   - 🚦 Station congestion and peak usage patterns
3. **Trend Analysis**: Evaluate seasonal patterns and growth metrics.

### 📐 Success Metrics
- 📊 Measure year-over-year growth in trip volume.
- 📍 Identify peak usage times and high-demand stations.
- 📅 Evaluate seasonal trends and their impact on customer behavior.

## 📅 Project Timeline (6 Weeks)
1. **Week 1**: Dataset assignment and initial design validation
2. **Weeks 2–3**: SQL and ETL development
3. **Weeks 3–4**: Finalize SQL queries and dashboard design; conduct peer review
4. **Weeks 5–6**: Dashboard development, testing, and user acceptance

## ⚠️ Considerations and Challenges
- **🔐 Data Access**: Requires approval from Jamal and other product teams.
- **🗺️ Geographic Aggregation**: Limited granularity in datasets; external database provided.
- **🌦️ Weather Data**: Availability and integration limitations.
- **🛡️ Data Privacy**: Ensure customer data anonymization.
- **♿ Accessibility**: Dashboard designed for large print and text-to-speech options.

## 🔑 Dashboard Access
Accessible to key stakeholders, including:
Adhira, Brianne, Ernest, Jamal, Megan, Nina, Rick, Shareefah, Sara, and Tessa.

## 📌 Conclusion
This BI project allowed me to leverage SQL, ETL processes, and data visualization to deliver actionable insights for Cyclistic. The interactive dashboard provides the leadership team with a comprehensive view of customer behavior and operational trends, supporting strategic decision-making and future growth initiatives.
